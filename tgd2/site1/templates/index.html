			<p>This is a budget hotel you can book direct with for very good prices. I took a budget room so can only comment on that, it was certainly a basic room but was spotless clean. The staff were all very good. The location on the side of town is good for access to town. Two negatives. The road outside can give noise and my shower was not great but still rine to actually shower in. For what you pay and if your not too fussy like myself it is superb value for Nairobi. Wifi was fine.</p>

			<p>The hotel was very nice.It was clean.You can go by walk to the center and enjoy the city (but be careful crossing the road). The staff was nice but they were very slow.If you are in a hurry, don't eat at the hotel restaurante, they spend lot of time</p>
